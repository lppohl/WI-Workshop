# Social Science and Language Models <br>
### Methods and theory to responsible research on and with Language technologies
<br>
<p> In recent years, language models have seen improved performance in tasks like translation, sorting, and text generation, which has led to their integration into a variety of fields, such as medical contexts, software engineering but also social science. Parallel to this technological proliferation, the emerging field of Responsible AI research has revealed various socio-technical biases in language models which result in discrimination based on attributes such as ethnicity, gender, and more. These findings force both social scientists and computer scientists who are integrating these tools into their research, to reflect how they can detect and mitigate potentially  biased outcomes. By doing so, they contribute to an expanding body of literature that critiques how discrimination is conceptualized, how bias measurements are operationalized, and how existing bias benchmarks are constructed. These issues stem from a lack of genuine interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and researchers from various social science disciplines.
</p>
This workshop is meant to provide the space for interdisciplinary exchange toward responsible research on and with language models.

Zeerak is a Chancellor’s Fellow (~Assistant Professor in the U.S.) in Responsible Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the Centre for Technomoral Futures and the School of Informatics, where they are a member of the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation, at the University of Edinburgh. Zeerak is one  of the 2024 visiting research fellows at HIIG ([https://www.hiig.de](https://www.hiig.de)), and have recently joined [DAIR](https://www.dair-institute.org/) (Distributed AI Research Institute) as a faculty fellow. They work on the intersection between machine learning, science and technology studies, and media studies. Zeerak's research seeks to examine how machine learning systems interact with our societies and the downstream effects of introducing machine learning to our society.
